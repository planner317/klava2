Blue his house with a blue little window and a blue Corvette and everything is blue for him and himself and everybody around cause he ain't got nobody to listen. I have a blue house with a blue window. Blue is the color of all that I wear. Blue are the streets and all the trees are too. I have a girlfriend and she is so blue. Blue are the people here that walk around. Blue like my Corvette that's standing outside. Blue are the words I say and what I think. Blue are the feelings that live inside me.`
